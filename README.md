# unit

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karan/unit/master/_dna.jpg?token=ADHGIXpzysS9hkZ0sEW0XDuvDLHM8Tk3ks5WT3XPwA%3D%3D)

A highly **modular**, **fast** API framework in Go backed by [martini](https://github.com/go-martini/martini), and distributed as a **Docker** container for easy installation and deployment.

`unit` is designed to be a highly modular and extensible API. These modules or extensions are called *units* and live in `units/` folder. Each unit is part of the `package units`.

`units` are independent modules that can do anything you want them to do. Imagine having one that can draw an image, another that saves an image to s3, and another that notifies users - all exposed through your own HTTP API.

Simply drop your `units` in the `units/` directory, and restart (rebuild) the API. `unit` discovers and links the API, and **installs the necessary dependencies** automagically.

To get started, take a look the [installation](#installation) steps, and [units docs](#writing-units).

- [Accessing the API](#accessing-the-api)
- [Writing Units](#writing-units)
  - [Examples](#examples)
- [Benchmark](#benchmark)

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/) (Mac OS X)

## Installation

- `$ git clone git@github.com:karan/unit.git && cd unit/`
- `$ docker-compose up`

#### Mac & Docker Machine

If you're using Docker Machine, follow these instructions for installation:

```bash
# Provision the docker engine
$ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox unit

# Set the environment
$ eval "$(docker-machine env unit)"

# See the IP address of the host
$ docker-machine ip unit

# Start the container
$ docker-compose up
```

## Accessing the API

If using Docker Machine, run `$ docker-machine ls` to find out the VM IP address.

If your IP is `192.168.99.100`, load `192.168.99.100:5000` in the browser of the computer running docker to access the API.

## Writing units

Every unit must import at least these two:

```go
import "github.com/go-martini/martini"
import "./../unit"
```

For any third-party imports, mark them with the `//- unit-deps` comment so `unit` can discover them and install them for you.

Example:

```go
import (
  "github.com/go-martini/martini"

  "./../unit"

  "github.com/martini-contrib/render" //- unit-dep
)
```

The only thing needed after that is to register at least one group of routes like so:

```go
g := unit.Group(func(router martini.Router) {

  // Use martini like you would
  router.Get("/1", func() string {
    return "v2 - 1!"
  })

  router.Get("/2", func() string {
    return "v2 - 2!"
  })

})

// Register with the following path
g.Register("/v2")
```

The routes will then be available at `host/v2/1` and `host/v2/2`.

The most beautiful thing here is that you use martini to setup the routes like you normally would. You have full access to all features of martini - you can render a static page, or send JSON or send XML response. `unit` does not really care.

#### Example

[`units/plugin1.go`](https://github.com/karan/unit/blob/master/units/plugin1.go)
```go
package units

import (
  "github.com/go-martini/martini"

  "./../unit"
)

func init() {
  g := unit.Group(func(router martini.Router) {

    router.Get("/1", func() string {
      return "v2 - 1!"
    })

    router.Get("/2", func() string {
      return "v2 - 2!"
    })

  })

  g.Register("/v2")
}

```

## Benchmark

`unit` is fast as a cheetah.

```bash
$ ab -n 1000 -c 20 http://192.168.99.100:5000/v1/1
